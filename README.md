# TeamMulticast-CoAP-PubSub
This is the repository for the Multicast team's project for the course II1305 at KTH.


The goal of the project is to implement the IETS's RFC for CoAP publish-subscribe possibly as an API/library for general use, and then build a front-end client app to show live data published from a network of sensors through a broker to subscribed clients using the aforementioned API. The project is commissioned by the KTH Network Systems Laboratory. You can read more about it here: https://www.kth.se/cos/research/nslab
